Here is the [link](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/146/) to the competition.

The model's performance is not acceptable, likely due to several contributing factors, which I plan to address. First, the short sequence lengths are a significant issue; when grouping by `obs_id`, the maximum sequence length was only 4 events, which is insufficient for the model to learn meaningful patterns. I will explore alternative methods for clustering the events to create longer sequences. Additionally, the limited amount of training data—30,000 rows, representing just 1.8% of the total dataset—likely contributes to underfitting. Expanding the dataset should improve the model's generalization. Furthermore, the model's complexity might be excessive given the data constraints, and the dropout layers did not have a noticeable effect on the training process or loss evaluation, suggesting that the current model may not be benefiting from regularization.
